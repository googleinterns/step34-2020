# MapIT

This repository contains the capstone project of Places iOS STEP interns.
Play around with it [here!](https://step-34-2020.web.app/)

## Objective

The objective of MapIT is to manage and visualize student-created public events, and expose these events to their college community.  The visual representation of the events is a map with markers to where they occur.  Ideally, with the map visualization of each user event created, the app will inform students of the opportunities to socialize and experience new opportunities on their campuses, and encourage them to diversify their social circles.


## Background

Despite the diversity of people and thought that exists on college campuses, students can often limit their experiences to their own “social bubble.”  Many students are interested in meeting new people, trying out new hobbies, and learning more about other people's perspectives.  However, they may not have the proper tools to learn about social gatherings, club meetings, or volunteer efforts happening on their campus.  While a search on Facebook Events could help a student find events, an application that shows their locations relative to the user would provide more readily accessible and interactive information.
With the combination of visualizing event data and common issues on finding when and where an event happens within a local community, the team proposed that MapIT could potentially solve this common issue while also providing a user friendly way of efficiently visualizing event data.

## Main Libraries

MapIT uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [Google Maps API](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react), [Google Places Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, and Firebase Storage.
